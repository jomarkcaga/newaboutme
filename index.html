					 <h2> WHAT IS YOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE IN LIFE </h2>	  
						 <b> "Gratitdue" </b>
					<p> Practicing gratitude, by focusing on and appreciating what one already possesses instead of fixating on what is lacking, is crucial as it cultivates positive emotions and has the potential to enhance overall well-being. </p>
						
						 <h3> WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST ACHIEVMENTS IN LIFE </h3>
						 <p> One of the most significant achievements during my time as a student was being chosen to take part in a junior high competition. This particular event stood out as a memorable and impactful moment in my academic trajectory, instilling a sense of assurance in my skills as a computer engineer. </p>
					
					<h4> WHAT IS YOUR FUTURE PLANS </h4>
					<p> I intend to further my education by pursuing a Master's degree in a computer-related field. My strong interest in technology and its capacity to address real-world issues drives this decision. Through this advanced degree, I aim to enhance my expertise and acquire the necessary skills to make a significant difference in the industry. Once I finish my studies, my goal is to secure a position at a technology company where I can utilize my abilities and continue to develop as a professional. </p>
